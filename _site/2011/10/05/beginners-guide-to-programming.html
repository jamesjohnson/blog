      <div id='body' class='entry-content instapaper_body'><p>I learned the basics of web programming about 18 months ago building a small <span class="caps">PHP</span> app that tracked returns for a startup I was working for. It was fun, but after I built a basic <span class="caps">CRUD</span> interface, I found it hard to move past the initial phases. I got some advice that Ruby on Rails was a great way to keep moving forward, and so I spent 8 months building simple webapps using the rails framework. The &#8220;hardest&#8221; part for me looking back on my experience was the first couple of weeks. For someone who is new to development, text editors and the terminal &#8211; the installation process can be really overwhelming.</p>
<p>Recently a lot of my buddies have asked me to get them set up with Rails so that they can learn to build cool stuff, and I always laugh that what takes 15 minutes now, took me a good 2-3 weeks the first time I went through it. I will do my best to outline below <span class="caps">EXACTLY</span> what it takes to get the most basic of webapps set up. Once you have a webapp, you can read the scaffold code from the views, controllers and models, and get sense for how a Ruby on Rails app works.</p>
<p>1) This won&#8217;t work on a PC and the process is a little different for Ubuntu(which I got set up on). You can buy used macbooks on eBay pretty cheap, or dualboot your PC with Ubuntu. I had someone who knew what they were doing help me with the latter when I started &#8211; but I do think a Mac is the best option.</p>
<p>2) Install X-Code in the App Store. If you have the Lion operating system installed, its free, otherwise you will need to Download it from Apple.com and it costs ~$5 I think &#8211; Lion is great and $29 so I would advise downloading Lion. You can also get Lion in the App store.<br />
<img src='/images/posts/learning_rails/xcode.png' /></p>
<p>3) Once X-code is installed &#8211; next step is installing homebrew. The homebrew githib is <a href='https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation'>here.</a> All you need to do is open your terminal from spotlight.<br />
<img src='/images/posts/learning_rails/spotlight.png' /><br />
and copy and paste in the following command:<br />
<br/>
<code>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"</code><br />
<br/>
It should look something like this:<br />
<img src='/images/posts/learning_rails/terminal.png' /><br />
From here you should see a bunch of output. If there are any points where you are asked a question, just hit enter.</p>
<p>4) After x-code is installed &#8211; its time to install git. This is really easy to do with the homebrew install. In the same way that you copy and pasted the homebrew install, you copy and paste the following line of code which will install git.<br />
<br/>
<code>brew install git</code><br />
<br/>
Again there will be a bunch of output, but there shouldn&#8217;t be any issues with the install</p>
<p>5) Next step is installing <span class="caps">RVM</span> &#8211; this is a ruby tool that makes managing different versions of ruby much easier. When I started this was really confusing for me, so don&#8217;t worry about it too much right now. If you would like to read up on <span class="caps">RVM</span> (which you should!) the link is  <a href='http://beginrescueend.com/'>here.</a> To install <span class="caps">RVM</span> copy and paste the following (same as before) into the terminal.<br />
<br/>
<code>bash &lt; &lt;(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer)</code><br />
<br/></p>
<p>6) This is the most complicated part of the install for a new user, you need to add <span class="caps">RVM</span> to your path so that you can access it everytime you use the terminal. This is done by creating or adding to an existing .bashrc file. In your terminal copy and paste the following:</p>
<p><code>vim ~/.bashrc</code></p>
<p>You are using a texteditor that allows you to edit files. Vim has a series of commands that are great for developers but hard for a first timer to pick up. </p>
<p>If there is code existing in this file, use the down arrow (note left and right won&#8217;t work) go to the bottom of the file and press the letter <span class='light'>i</span> once. Go to the end of the line using the arrow keys and hit enter to go onto a new line. If you make a mistake at any point. Hit the <span class='light'>esc</span> key and press <span class='light'>u</span>. Once at the bottom of the file, paste on a new line the following code:</p>
<p><code>[[ -s $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm ]] &amp;&amp; . $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm</code></p>
<p>Once the code is there press the <span class='light'>esc</span> key, then type in the following <span class='light'>:wq</span>. the <span class='light'>:wq</span> should show up in the bottom nav of the program, you should not be typing this into the file itself. <span class='light'>:w</span> is the command to save a file in vim and <span class='light'>:q</span> is the command to quit, together they will save and quit. When you type <span class='light'>:wq</span> it will save the ~/.bashrc file and exit.</p>
<p><img src='/images/posts/learning_rails/bashrc.png' /></p>
<p>7)After adding <span class="caps">RVM</span> to the path, you will need to exit out of the terminal and reopen it. Next step is to install ruby and then rails! To do so, copy and paste in the following commands to the terminal:</p>
<p>This will install Ruby</p>
<p><code>rvm install ruby-1.9.2-p290</code></p>
<p>Once it is done installing you need to tell <span class="caps">RVM</span> that you would like to use Ruby 1.9.2</p>
<p><code>rvm use 1.9.2</code></p>
<p>You should get a green confirm message that this worked, next time to install Rails. First confirm gems are updated and then install rails.</p>
<p><code>gem update --system</code></p>
<p><code>gem install rails</code></p>
<p>8)You won&#8217;t need this right away, but to use 3rd party libraries (called gems in rails) you should install bundler now. Really helpful way to manage 3rd party software you applications will rely on.</p>
<p><code>gem install bundler</code></p>
<p>9)Now create your first rails app! <br />
<code>rails new blog</code></p>
<p>and then type in the following to &#8220;change directory&#8221; into your new application. Imagine that CD is the same as using a mouse to click on a directory to view its files. cd is the same concept.</p>
<p><code>cd blog</code></p>
<p>and generate some scaffolding code, migrate the database, and start the server (this will create your first app!):<br />
<code>rails g scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean</code><br />
<code>rake db:migrate</code><br />
<code>rails s</code></p>
<p>10)Now check out the following url to see your <span class="caps">VERY</span> first rails app: <a href='http://0.0.0.0:3000/posts'>http://0.0.0.0:3000/posts</a></p></div>
